# Bayesian_optimisation
Code that finds optimised hyperparameters using Bayesian optimisation for RNN and CNN that predicts the Hurst exponents for fbm tracks
Code has been tested with python 3.10 and 3.9, and tensorflow 2.12.0
Make sure you pip install scikit-optimize (for the bayesian optimization code) and pip install stochastic
